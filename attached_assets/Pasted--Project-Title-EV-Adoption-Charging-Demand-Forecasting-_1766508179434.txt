🎯 Project Title

EV Adoption & Charging Demand Forecasting System

🧠 Prompt

You are a senior AI architect, data scientist, and full-stack engineer.
Build a production-grade, end-to-end web application that predicts future Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption and charging demand using historical EV datasets.

📌 Problem Statement

Electric vehicle adoption is rapidly increasing, creating uncertainty around future charging infrastructure demand. Governments, city planners, and charging-station operators need accurate forecasting systems to avoid under- or over-building infrastructure.

The goal is to:

Predict future EV population growth

Forecast charging demand (sessions, energy required)

Visualize trends for decision-makers

Provide scalable, real-world usable solution

📊 Dataset Description

Assume the dataset may contain:

Year / Date

Region / City / State

Total EV count

EV type (BEV, PHEV, Commercial, Private)

Historical charging sessions

Charging energy consumed (kWh)

Population or vehicle ownership stats

If some columns are missing:
